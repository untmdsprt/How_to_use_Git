1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

 Diff showed the differences between the files so you can find them faster and make changes.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

 It will show you what you've done in the past and how you've progressed. What
mistakes did you make, and how have you improved writing more efficient code.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

 Pros - you get to decide when you want to make a commit when it makes sense to do so.
      For example, when you're finished with a function after making numerous changes.
      It also keeps a history of what changes have been made so you can refer back
      to older items.

 Cons - there's always a chance that you might forget to save and everything is lost.

4. How can you use the commands ```git log``` and ```git diff``` to view the history of files?

 ```git log``` shows everything you've done so far in the history of starting the project.
 ```git diff``` just shows the differences of each file.
